    <h2>About This Site</h2><hr class="style-one">
    <br>

    <h4>1. What is the purpose of this website?</h4>
    <p class="text-style1">
        This website is created for sharing japanese anime and game music information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>2. Why you create this website?</h4>
    <p class="text-style1">
        Just out of interest and hobbies. I am crazy about japanese anime and game music when I was a pupil.
        But not just like the music itself,
        also interesting about the musician behind the music. I am a amatrue music creator, instrument player, so I know
        how important they are.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>3. What are the features of this website?</h4>
    <p class="text-style1">
        1. You will find out the musician behind your favorite music. Not only the composer or singer, but also the other player
        (like drummer, guitarist, etc...) if they are listed in the CD booklet or mentioned through twitter (Internet).<br>
        2. Provided harmony progression or music sheet image file of some songs. This is not the main goal of this website. There
        are some wonderful website do this which already cover the most of anime music or game music. I would recommend:

        <a style="color: blueviolet;text-decoration: underline;" href="http://ja.chordwiki.org/">  Wiki Chord</a>
        <br>
        If some music they didn't cover, then I will consider to do that.
        <br>
        3. I will gives a brief appraisement for some songs if I really want to say something.
        <br>
        4. This website is not just showing things, you can also help me to complete this website together.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>4. What can I do in this website?</h4>
